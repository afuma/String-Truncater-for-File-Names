# String-Truncater-for-File-Names

Truncate filenames with the prefix "AnyConv.com__"
It's a static program. Your are not able to change that prefix.

It's takes the absolute path of the directory that contains all the sub-directories 
in wich all files with the prefix "AnyConv.com__" are truncate for having the final result without that prefix.

One method to having the absolute path:
  - do a right-click with your mouse
  - go to the propriety of the file
  - copy the absolute path

Afterthat, you just have to paste it in the command line where your program is waiting it.
