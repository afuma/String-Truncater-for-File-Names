# String-Truncater-for-File-Names

Description
This project truncates filenames with the prefix "AnyConv.com__". It is a static program, meaning you cannot change this prefix.

Prerequisites
You must have Python installed on your computer to run this project.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/String-Truncater-for-File-Names.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd String-Truncater-for-File-Names

Usage
Place main.py wherever it's easy to access. Then, in your favorite terminal, run the attached Python program like this:

python3 main.py
The program takes the absolute path of the directory that contains all the subdirectories where all files with the prefix "AnyConv.com__" will be truncated to remove that prefix.

Obtaining the Absolute Path
To obtain the absolute path of a directory:

Right-click on the directory.
Go to the properties of the directory.
Copy the absolute path.
After that, simply paste it into the command line where your program is waiting for it.

Features
Automatically truncates filenames starting with "AnyConv.com__".
